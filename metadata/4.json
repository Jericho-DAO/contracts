    "description": "When Vulka died, her giant body was petrified on top of Mount Hudur, Jericho’s biggest mountain. Her legs got destroyed in the process & scrambled into fragments we call Hudur’s Stone, a unique stone that unveils true intentions. It is now used to produce Hudur‘s Anvils: Jericho’s ID. As soon as you get one, you’ll be recognized as a true Builder, and get access to all the Discord channels and our wiki.",
